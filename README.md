Week 9 Lecture Reflection

I managed to do most of the shaders today and I actually got to play around with the script part of some of them too. The shadow with texture shader had some issues but with the help of some peers, I got to make it work and look mostly correct.

 All the shaders worked today which is nice besides the glass one but I had a semi fix by just using the transparency code from last week. The whole thing can become transparent but it's not 100% accurate to glass. 
 I just used  Blend DstColor SrcColor to make it semi-transparent.

The water one I'm the most satisfied with.

 I think I did better just playing around with the shaders more as some were not working which forced me to be more practical this lecture.
